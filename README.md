#DRILL: When to use surveys State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

Popularity of various Uber drivers. 
- Yes

A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. 
- You could use a survey, but you wouldn't really know who to send it to and there is a chance that people wouldn't even reply to the survey.  It is more effective to track the sales of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream instead.  You can take this raw data and create analysis from it that would be more effective than a survey.

Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. 
- This is personal information and while you can ask respondent's their sexual orientation, this is no means is a required field.  You would get some survey replies back, but it can be skewed depending on whether or not people feel like responding to that question.

Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 
- Yes.  Maybe look at compiling a survey that would include factors that would lead to an increase - maybe economic, environmental, etc.  Can compile survey results to gather the information in order to put into motion sales plays to keep the increase going.

Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 
- Yes and no.  You can use a survey to ask respondents certain questions.  However, you can also track whether or not the advertising campaign is successful by tracking increase or decrease of sales.

Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
- No.  This is analysis that you can compile by using compiled/available data instead of creating a survey.
